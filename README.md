# Welcome to my Web Development Learning Repository!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository where I document my journey of learning web development, encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, you'll find information on the structure of this repository, how to navigate it, and the resources I've found helpful along the way.

# Repository Structure:
HTML: This directory contains all the HTML files I've created during my learning process. Each file represents a project, exercise, or concept I've explored.

CSS: Here, you'll find CSS files corresponding to the HTML files in the 'HTML' directory. These files contain styles I've applied to my web pages to enhance their appearance and layout.

JavaScript: In this directory, I've stored JavaScript files that I've used to add interactivity and functionality to my web pages. You'll find scripts for various purposes, such as form validation, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

# How to Use:
Exploring Code: To view the code for a specific project or concept, simply navigate to the corresponding directory. You can then open the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your preferred code editor to examine and modify the code.

Running Projects: To see a project in action, open its HTML file in a web browser. You can interact with the project and observe its behavior directly in the browser window.

Contributions: If you have suggestions for improvement, spot errors, or want to contribute to my learning journey, feel free to submit a pull request. I welcome constructive feedback and collaboration!

Happy coding !
